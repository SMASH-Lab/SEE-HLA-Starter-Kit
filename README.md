The SEE HLA Starter Kit is a software package that greatly simplifies the task of building HLA federates that need to be compliant with the SpaceFOM standard. Historically, it has been used in the Simulation Exploration Experience (SEE) program to support the development of distributed components of space simulations by student teams across the world. It includes the following:

* A **software framework** known as the Starter Kit Framework (SKF) provided as a Java library
* **Technical documentation** in the form of a dedicated **wiki**, **JavaDocs**, and **sample code**
* A **starter template project** called *Baseplate* that enables rapid setup and development of federates

The SKF is intuitively-designed to serve as a simplified abstraction of the HLA Java API. As of the latest release (v2), it is fully compliant with the latest specifications of the HLA standard, **IEEE 1516-2025 (HLA 4)**, and has been successfully tested on **Pitch pRTI**, an industry-leading RTI implementation from **BAE Systems OneArc**.

The latest release of the framework is available from the [releases](https://github.com/SMASH-Lab/SEE-HLA-Starter-Kit/releases) page. The [wiki](https://github.com/SMASH-Lab/SEE-HLA-Starter-Kit/wiki) contains detailed instructions for building from source and other relevant documentation.

The development of the SEE HLA Starter Kit is an international effort that sees contributions from the following institutions:

* Systems Engineering and Integration (SEI) team in the System Modeling and Simulation Hub (SMASH) Lab of the Department of Informatics, Modeling, Electronics, and Systems Engineering (DIMES) at the **University of Calabria** (Italy)
* **NASA Johnson Space Center** (Houston, TX, United States)
* The Modelling and Simulation Group (MSG) at **Brunel University of London** (United Kingdom)

## Acknowledgement

The SKF development team thanks Edwin Z. Crues (NASA JSC) for his valuable input and suggestions that aided the development of the SEE HLA Starter Kit. A big thank you to the NASA staff involved in the Simulation Exploration Experience (SEE) for organizing the program each year to great effect: Priscilla Elfrey, Paige Whittington, Stephen Paglialonga, Michael Conroy, Dan Dexter, Daniel Oneil, and Björn Möller (BAE Systems OneArc). We also thank our users, the members of teams that have participated in SEE over the years as well.

A special note of immense gratitude to Garratt Weblin and the BAE Systems OneArc organization for graciously providing assistance and software licenses, which facilitated the development of the upgraded version 2.0 of the SEE HLA Starter Kit.
